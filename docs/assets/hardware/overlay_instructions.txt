# Board Overlay Coordinate Guide

To properly annotate your board image, you'll need to identify the pixel coordinates
for each component. Here's how:

1. Open the image in an image editor (Preview, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Use the cursor position indicator to find the x,y coordinates for each component
3. Update the 'components' list in the create_board_overlay() function
4. Re-run the script

## Estimated positions (adjust based on your image):

Based on typical board layout, components are usually located:
- SD Card: Left side, middle
- Speaker terminals: Right side, middle  
- Audio jack: Right side, below speaker
- Power input: Right side, top
- I/O connections: Top center
- SBUS: Left side, top
- Maestro connections: Center
- WiFi module: ESP32 chip location
- DFPlayer: Small module near audio

## Current placeholder coordinates:
1. SD Card Slot: (100, 250)
2. Speaker Output: (350, 320)
3. 3.5mm Audio Jack: (350, 380)
4. Power Input: (500, 200)
5. I/O Connections: (450, 100)
6. SBUS Input: (200, 100)
7. Maestro Output: (300, 150)
8. WiFi Module: (150, 200)
9. DFPlayer Mini: (250, 300)

Adjust these in the script for accurate placement.
