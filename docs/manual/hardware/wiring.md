# Wiring Guide

Proper wiring is crucial for reliable operation of the Kyber Control System. This guide covers all aspects of connecting components safely and effectively.

## Power Connections

!!! danger "Voltage Warning"
    Always verify voltage requirements before connecting power. Incorrect voltage can damage components.

### Power Supply Requirements
- Input Voltage: 7.4V - 12V DC
- Current Capacity: Based on servo count
- Clean power source recommended

### Wiring Best Practices
1. Use appropriate wire gauge
2. Keep wire runs short
3. Proper strain relief
4. Clean solder joints

## Servo Connections

### Standard Servo Wiring
- Red: Power (+)
- Black/Brown: Ground (-)
- Yellow/White/Orange: Signal

### Connection Tips
1. Verify connector orientation
2. Ensure solid connections
3. Route wires neatly
4. Avoid sharp bends

## Questions for Clarification

!!! question "For Project Owner"
    1. What are the recommended wire gauges for different power requirements?
    2. Are there specific servo brands/models that require special consideration?
    3. What is the maximum recommended wire length for servo connections?
    4. Are there any specific power supply brands or models you recommend?
    5. Should we include instructions for custom wire harnesses?
