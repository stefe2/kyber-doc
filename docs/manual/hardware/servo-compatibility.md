## Servo Compatibility

The Kyber Control System is designed to work with all standard servo brands and models. This universal compatibility ensures maximum flexibility for your projects.

### Supported Servo Types
- Standard RC servos
- Digital servos
- High-torque servos
- Mini/micro servos
- Continuous rotation servos

### Servo Specifications
- Operating Voltage: 4.8V - 6V (typical)
- Pulse Width Range: 500-2500 Î¼s
- Control Frequency: Up to 333Hz

!!! note "Compatibility Note"
    While all standard servo brands are supported, always verify the voltage and current requirements of your specific servos to ensure proper power supply configuration.

## Connection Guidelines

### Standard Servo Wiring
1. Red/Brown: Power (+)
2. Black/Red: Ground (-)
3. Yellow/Orange/White: Signal

### Power Requirements
- Voltage: 4.8V - 6V for most servos
- Current: Varies by servo type and load
- Recommend separate power supply for multiple servos

## Installation Tips

1. Double-check wire polarity before connecting
2. Use appropriate power supply for your servos
3. Consider current draw when using multiple servos
4. Test movement range before final installation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Servo not responding
    - Check wiring connections
    - Verify power supply
    - Test signal from controller
    
2. Erratic movement
    - Check power supply stability
    - Verify signal integrity
    - Inspect for loose connections

3. Overheating
    - Check for mechanical binding
    - Verify voltage settings
    - Reduce duty cycle if necessary
